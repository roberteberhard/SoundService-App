# Building a YouToube Playlist App with Vue.js and the WordPress REST API

SoundServie simply lists my curated video playlists where you can watch or listen to the music video. The SPA is made with Vue.js on top of the WordPress REST API.

## Vue
Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

## REST
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style which advocates that the web applications should use HTTP.

## WordPress REST API
The WordPress REST API provides API endpoints for WordPress data types that allow developers to interact with sites remotely by sending and receiving JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. JSON is an open standard data format that is lightweight and human-readable, and looks like Objects do in JavaScript.
